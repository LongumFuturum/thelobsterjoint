      <p>Our menu features a range of seafood dishes that showcase the best of California’s coastal cuisine. From raw oysters and clams on the half shell to calamari fries and crab cakes, our appetizers alone are enough to make your mouth water. But it’s our lobster that really steals the show, with options ranging from classic steamed lobster with drawn butter to more inventive dishes like lobster Mac and cheese or lobster rolls with a California twist.</p>
